 * arm
 * aarch64
 * mips
 * mips64
 * x86
 * x86_64

Specifying arm isn't particularly interesting (since the default
target for the buildbot is hammerhead), but there are some differences
in the math instructions available for the default ARM target, so it
could be helpful for testing changes to the compiler-rt builtins.

56,[WIP] Enable optimizations for Arm64,"[WIP] Enable optimizations for Arm64

This CL enables optimizations that I believe are safe to enable.

The ones not enabled:

kLoadHoisting requires rework of PC def/use.  In arm32 we used updates
to the pc register to provide a barrier to hoisting loads above
branches.

kSuppressLoads requires kTrackLiveTemps, which is on hold while we
are working through the RefReg consistency issues.

kTrackLiveTemps needs debugging (likely problems around equality of
32 and 64-bit views of core registers (in particularly, those used
as references).

kPromoteRegs needs CL 99080 debugged and submitted.

kBBOpt may be ready, but will likely need debugging of the fused
branches.

Also, note that intrinsics and inlined methods are still turned off.

In 64 bit processes on Nexus 9, sizeof(MediaImage) is 160, not 156.
In these cases, there is 4 bytes padding between the type field
and the next 64 bit field.

This fixes using the getInputImage/getOutputImage methods in
64 bit mode.

Keep the existing behaviour for the case if sizeof(MediaImage)
would be 156, if that is the case in other 64 bit ABIs (such
as x86_64 and mips64).

The alternative would be to change the type of the mType field
in MediaImage to size_t, to reduce the risk of non-obvious
alignment/padding between fields within the struct, clearly
getting rid of the possibility of the struct being 156 bytes
large in 64 bit environments.

NVIDIA Tegra comment on why these device are secure

/dev/tegra-throughput accepts a frame rate target
from onscreen EGL applications. The frame rate
target is used in gpu frequency scaling. This feature
applies only when running a single application. While
multiple clients are connected, gpu scaling does not
use the frame rate targets and falls back to load
based scaling instead. Since EGL applications aren__
required to have any special permissions, this node
must be accessible to all clients. Abusing this
interface would be difficult in that no frame rate
information is available if no client is swapping
buffers, so writing a value would have no effect; at
most a malicious client could cause gpu frequency
scaling to fall back to load based scaling when a
single (legitimate) client is connected. Other than
the file open/ close operation it supports a
single ioctl. The ioctl parameter is cast to an
unsigned integer, and no further data is read. No
buffer overrun is possible.

/dev/nvhost-gpu, /dev/nvhost-as-gpu,
/dev/nvhost-ctrl-gpu are used by all GL applications
for accessing GPU. All GPU contexts are protected
from each other with GMMU (GPU Memory Management Unit)

/dev/nvhost-vic Each program that draws on screen
using acceleration sends the rendering commands to
kernel directly to maximize efficiency. This is why
access to nvhost-vic is required.

/dev/nvhost-dbg-gpu is used by the CUDA driver and
debugger for accessing registers on the GPU, changing
powergating state and getting notified about traps
on the GPU. The interface is secured by maintaining
a whitelist of registers that are allowed to be
accessed from usermode, maintaining a refcount so
that power features are restored once the usermode
process exits, and requiring the usermode process
to bind the graphics channel fd to the interface
via an ioctl.

/dev/nvhost-prof-gpu is also used by the CUDA
profiler for accessing registers on the GPU, changing
powergating state and getting notified about traps
on the GPU. The interface is secured by maintaining
a whitelist of registers that are allowed to be
accessed from usermode, maintaining a refcount so
that power features are restored once the usermode
process exits. This interface makes binding a channel
fd optional. In the absence of a bound channel fd,
userspace cannot access channel-specific contexts.

97,ART: Force clearing higher bits when converting long to int,"ART: Force clearing higher bits when converting long to int

The following problem description is taken from
https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/107261
  If destination and source of long-to-int is the same physical
  register on 64-bit then we do not emit any instructions but
  consider that destination is a 32-bit view of source register.
  As a result high part contains garbage. If the destination is
  used later as index to array access then this garbage is used
  in computation of address because address is 64-bit. For all
  other cases garbage is just ignored.

For 64-bit target this patch forces generating reg-to-reg copy
even if the src and dest are the same physical registers. This
makes the higher bits be zeroed.

Currently dataflow information is not calculated for catch blocks in order to
reduce overhead. However, this makes assumption that the lack of this
information is only preventing local optimizations to catch block. But in
reality this problematic for global optimizations.

Basically, when dataflow is not allocated for a block, then ssa is not computed
for that block either. When ssa is not computed, other optimizations which
need to know all uses of ssa register do not see it in the catch block.
Complete information is required for correctness.

125,"Runtime resource overlay, iteration 2","Runtime resource overlay, iteration 2

Support any number of overlays. Support any target package.

In runtime resource overlay, iteration 1, only a single overlay
package was considered. Matching was based on file paths
(/vendor/overlay/system/framework-res.apk corresponding to
/system/framework-res.apk). Introduce a more flexible identification of
overlay packages so that any package is an overlay package if if
specifies the following manifest

<manifest>
    <overlay target=""T"" priority=""P""/>
</manifest>

where T is the package name of the target package, ie the package whose
resources are to be overlaid, and P is an integer [0, 9999] described
below.

During resource lookup, packages are queried to provide a best match
given a configuration. If any package can provide a better match than
what has been found so far, the previous match is discarded. The
priority value P provides the order in which to query overlay packages.
Packages with higher priority value will be queried later. Target
packages are always queried last.

Two overlay packages with the same priority targeting the same target
package leads to undefined behaviour.

The idmap file format has been updated to include the paths to the
corresponding target and overlay packages. This makes idmap files act
both as translation data and as control files: if an idmap file is
present, then and only then should its overlay be loaded. This makes
it possible to enable and disable installed overlay packages. To cache
idmap files, the asset manager considers symbolic links to idmap files
rather than the files themselves.

Idmap files are created by the 'idmap' binary; idmap files must be
present when loading packages. For the Android system, Zygote calls
'idmap' as part of the resource pre-loading. For application packages,
'idmap' is invoked via 'installd' during package installation (similar
to 'dexopt').

For security and version matching reasons, apply a self-imposed
restriction on overlay packages: only load overlays from
/vendor/overlay. This restriction may be relaxed in a future iteration.

The stand-alone program allows creation of idmap files at any given

This breaks the build environment instructions into branch-specific sections so that the documented environment requirements for each branch may evolve independently. Since I have only tested builds on 10.6 and 10.7, I tried to leave all other sections as untouched as possible.

While I cannot say that the instructions in the ""android-4.0.3_r1 branch and all earlier branches"" section are exactly correct, this change makes it obvious that building Master on a modern OS X environment is extremely easy. I think this will be valuable to developers who choose to work on Macs.

I'm trusting that developers who actually need to build earlier branches will update the documentation in those sections.

159,Unify how base and overlay packages are matched,"Unify how base and overlay packages are matched

This commit removes the legacy strategy for matching base and overlay
packages, based on explicit path names (eg [1] and [2]). The only
recognized strategy going forward is specifying overlay packages with
the following tag in their AndroidManifest.xml files:

  <manifest>
    <overlay target=""..."" priority=""...""/>
    ...
  </manifest>

The target attribute is the package name of the base package; the
priority attribute an integer. A higher number corresponds to a higher
precedence. Packages with higher precedence will be consulted earlier
during resource lookup, effectively giving them the option to provide
a value for the requested resource or pass the request on to other
packages (configuration constraints and tighter configuration coherence
rules still apply).

Overlay packages must reside directly in /vendor/overlay. This is a
change from earlier commits, where overlay packages were expected to
reside in directories /vendor/overlay/framework and /vendor/overlay/app.

2) any other clear attempt will have no effect

What is actually happening:

In this case prune function will ""instruct"" the oldest timeEntry
to skip a huge number (very close to ULONG_MAX) of messages, this
being the cause of 1.
[fixed in LogTimeEntry::triggerSkip_Locked]

Since the consumer thread will skip all the log entries, mStart
updating will also be skipped. So a new cleaning attempt will have

170,ART: x86 specific clearing higher bits when converting long to int,"ART: x86 specific clearing higher bits when converting long to int

The following problem description is taken from
https://android-review.googlesource.com/107261
  If destination and source of long-to-int is the same physical
  register on 64-bit then we do not emit any instructions but
  consider that destination is a 32-bit view of source register.
  As a result high part contains garbage. If the destination is
  used later as index to array access then this garbage is used
  in computation of address because address is 64-bit. For all
  other cases garbage is just ignored.

A generic solution (113023) for all hw platforms was suggested
but rejected later for the sake of HW specific solution:
  https://android-review.googlesource.com/113023
  https://android-review.googlesource.com/114436

This patch is a rework of patch 113023 to stick with x86_64
specific changes: for 64-bit target this patch forces generating
reg-to-reg copy if the src and dest are the same physical
registers. This makes the higher bits be zeroed by 32-bit move
instruction.

Newer Android Linux kernels modify the way certain devices are
named, i.e.:

  /dev/qemu_pipe is renamed as /dev/goldfish_pipe.
  /dev/ttyS<num> is renamed as /dev/ttyGF<num>

This patch adds support code to the emulator to deal with this
as transparently as possible:

1) Add a new hardware property 'kernel.newDeviceNaming', a string
   which can only take the values 'autodetect', 'no', and 'yes'.

2) Support code to probe the type of a kernel image.
   IMPORTANT: The kernel implementation depends on the host
   /usr/bin/file to properly recognize kernel files and extract
   their version number. This really only works on Linux and
   OS X, and only for x86 and x86_64 kernel images.

   A future patch will implement more robust detection by
   essentially doing its own probing through libmagic or equivalent.

   Note that there doesn't seem to be any existing libmagic rules
   to recognize ARM and MIPS kernel images at the moment :-(

   See android/kernel/kernel_utils*

3) Modify the emulator startup code to perform auto-detection
   when possible (broken on Windows, and non Intel archs, see
   comment above).

4) Modify the kernel command line generation to handle the new
   TTY device naming

5) Modify the Goldfish pipe virtual device implementation
   (since the device name presented to the kernel also changed).

This should be enough to auto-detect Linux 3.10+ x86_64 kernel
images on Linux.

Locales like arabic have a multi char minusSign in
their locale data.

The only difficulty here is presented by DecimalFormatSymbols,
which is a public API and expects the minus sign to be
a single codepoint. The API has been changed to return the
first character of the minusSign string for getMinusSign, which
seems like the least bad option at this point.

The serialized form hasn't been modified either, since it's
public API as well and it isn't easy to expand to a String
without awkward semantics.

202,"Coalesce shared_app, media_app, release_app into untrusted_app.","Coalesce shared_app, media_app, release_app into untrusted_app.

This change folds the shared_app, media_app, and release_app
domains into untrusted_app, reducing the set of app domains down
to just distinct domains for the fixed UID apps (e.g. system_app, bluetooth,
nfc, radio), a single domain for apps signed by the platform key
(platform_app), and a single domain for all other apps (untrusted_app).
Thus, SELinux only distinguishes when already distinguished by a predefined
Android ID (AID) or by the platform certificate (which get the signature-only
Android permissions and thus may require special OS-level accesses).

It is still possible to introduce specific app domains for specific
apps by adding signer and package stanzas to mac_permissions.xml,
but this can be done on an as-needed basis for specialized apps that
require particular OS-level permissions outside the usual set.

As there is now only a single platform app domains, get rid of the
platformappdomain attribute and platform_app_domain() macro.  We used
to add mlstrustedsubject to those domains but drop this since we are not
using MLS in AOSP presently; we can revisit which domains need it if/when
we use MLS.

Since we are dropping the shared, media, and release seinfo entries from
seapp_contexts, drop them from mac_permissions.xml as well.  However,
we leave the keys.conf entries in case someone wants to add a signer
entry in the future for specific apps signed by those keys to
mac_permissions.xml.

243,Stop rmt_storage service from starting.,"Stop rmt_storage service from starting.

Flo devices don't have a radio and therefore
the rmt_storage service doesn't need to run.
Under some conditions having the rmt_storage
run can cause SELinux denials, but really
running this service just serves to waste
cycles.
